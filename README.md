## Projects

### Inaugural project

The results of the project can be seen from running inauguralproject.ipynb in the inauguralproject folder.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the NumPy package, the matplotlib package and the scipy package.
    
**Questions:** The code provides the calibration for each question for ease of access.
    
Note: Comments and notes are added to explain and present the method for each step for each question. 

### Data project

Our data project is titled **Age, Gender, Ethnicity and Income Differences** and is about income differences across groups with different demographic characteristics, such as gender, different ethnic groups and respective within group differences for age cohorts. The **results** of the project can be seen from running dataproject.ipynb in the dataproject folder.
    
We apply the **following datasets**:
    
1. IncomeEthnicityWomen.xlsx
2. IncomeEthnicityMen.xlsx
    
Both data sets were obtained from Danmarks Statistik: https://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/SelectVarVal/define.asp?MainTable=INDKP109&PLanguage=0&Tabstrip=&PXSId=0&SessID=458558904&FF=20&grouping1=201211208354114223874&tfrequency=1
    
**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the NumPy package, the Pandas package, the matplotlib package, the ipywidgets package, and the IPython.display package
    
Note: We encountered an error message when displaying the interactive plots once, which we could not reproduce. As we could not identify the reason for it, we note that restarting the kernel resolved the issue.

### Model project

Our model project is titled **Two-Country, Two Good Trade and Production Simulation**. We decided to draw on the Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O) model, which is a model in international economics that explains international trade patterns based on countries' differences in factor endowments. The core idea is that countries will export goods that intensively use their relatively abundant factors of production and import goods that intensively use their relatively scarce factors. Accordingly, the model draws on the concept of comparative advantages by considering multiple factors of production (here: technology, capital and labor), and highlights the importance of these factors' relative endowments in driving trade patterns.

The **results** of the model project can be seen from running modelproject.ipynb in the modelproject folder.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the NumPy package, the matplotlib package, the sympy package, the minimize function from the scipy.optimize package, and the Axes3D function from the mpl_toolkits.mplot3d package.

### Exam project

The **results** of the exam project can be seen from running examproject.ipynb in the examproject folder.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the NumPy package, the matplotlib package, the sympy package, and the minimize function from the scipy.optimize package.

**Declaration of Use of AI-tools:** In the examproject folder, we have provided text files that document our use of AI tools in solving the exam questions.

# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Age, Gender, Ethnicity and Income Differences** and is about income differences across groups with different demographic characteristics, such as gender, different ethnic groups and respective within group differences for age cohorts.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. IncomeEthnicityWomen.xlsx
2. IncomeEthnicityMen.xlsx

Both data sets were obtained from Danmarks Statistik: https://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/SelectVarVal/define.asp?MainTable=INDKP109&PLanguage=0&Tabstrip=&PXSId=0&SessID=458558904&FF=20&grouping1=201211208354114223874&tfrequency=1

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the NumPy package, the Pandas package, the matplotlib package, the ipywidgets package, and the IPython.display package

Note: We encountered an error message when displaying the interactive plots once, which we could not reproduce. As we could not identify the reason for it, we note that restarting the kernel resolved the issue.

The edgeworth box above illustrates the respective allocations for the preceding tasks, which shows quite well how the results differ from each other. On top of that, the scatter plot displays the respective utilities for each scenario for both players A and B as well as the total utility (A+B). This makes it easy to infer which scenario benefits each player most and where the total utility is the highest. For scenario 3, where the market clearing price is selected by minimizing the market clearing error over a set of prices P1, total utility seems to be be the highest, scoring just over 1.1. For scnearios 4a and 4b, where A seeks to maximize utility either within the price set P1 or for any positive price, (...). Scenarios 5a and 5b, where A also seeks to maximize utility but leaves B not worse off than initial endowment, the results seem similar for both the allocation where the choice set is restricted to C and where no further restrictions are imposed. In both cases, A scores the highest utility of all scenarios, reaching value sof around 0.74. Surpisingly, the utilitaroan social planner in task 6a seems not able to yield better results than the market clearing price. Here, total utility adds up to 1.06.
